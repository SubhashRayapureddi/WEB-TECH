<h2>Difference between Undefined and notdefined</h2> 
<b>Undefined : </b>Whenever we declare a variable without assigning any value to it, javascript implicitly assigns its value as 
undefined.<br>
<b>not defined : </b>A not defined is a variable which is not declared at a given point of time with declaration keyword like var, 
let or const.
